# Service-Oriented-Architecture

Service oriented architecture is all about how to build, use and combine services.

You -> Car Service -> Car Maintenance service
    -> Meal Service -> Food Supply Service
    -> Laundry Service -> Appliance Maintenance Service

Bringing the concept of services into software. Instead of building large software suites that do everything.
Once service oriented archotecture is in place, it is very powerful because it provides modularity, extensibilitya and code reuse. Applications can be built by combining services. New services can be created by combining by combining exisitng services or new services can be created from the ground up or by adding interfaces to existing code.

Service Principles / Best Practices:

1. Modular : Services should be modular and loosely coupled. In object oriented programming, loose coupling is achieved by only exposing the relevant elements of a class or components to its clients. In service oriented architecture, requests are made by passing communcation to the service in way that aligns with its interface. The service performs necessary operations then passes back a communication containing the results of the service or a confirmation that the requst was fulfilled.
2. Composable: 
3. Platform and Language independent: a sverice which is coded in java can be used by a servcie requester coded in Ruby.Platform and language indepedebce is achieved by following communication standards and protocols.
4. Self Describing:
5. Self Advertising:


The relationship bwetween web browser nad wb server is a client server relationship. both the request and responce are messages conveyed in HTTP. a communication protocol that both the web browser and web server understand.
static page are stored on the wen server, while dynamic pages are built by the web server when they are requested.
The desktop appications are run and are stored locally on your computer, whereas web applications run in your web browser, and are stored on a remote web server.
Web applications are platform indepwendent, meaning that the application will run on any operating syetem, provided that a compatible web browser is installed. web applicaiton almost always require users to have internet access because information is communicated over HTTP
