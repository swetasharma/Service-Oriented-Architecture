# Service-Oriented-Architecture

Service oriented architecture is all about how to build, use and combine services.

You -> Car Service -> Car Maintenance service
    -> Meal Service -> Food Supply Service
    -> Laundry Service -> Appliance Maintenance Service

Bringing the concept of services into software. Instead of building large software suites that do everything.
Once service oriented archotecture is in place, it is very powerful because it provides modularity, extensibilitya and code reuse. Applications can be built by combining services. New services can be created by combining by combining exisitng services or new services can be created from the ground up or by adding interfaces to existing code.
